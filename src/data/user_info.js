        description: "Hello, my name is Swetha Paspunuri, and I am a Java Full Stack Developer with over three years of experience designing and implementing scalable web applications. My expertise spans both front-end and back-end development, leveraging Java technologies such as Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Security, and Hibernate to build robust, high-performance applications. On the front end, I work with frameworks like React.js, Angular, JavaScript, and TypeScript to create intuitive and responsive user interfaces. My technical skill set also includes experience with MySQL, MongoDB, and Oracle databases, ensuring efficient data management through JPA/Hibernate. I am proficient in using Python alongside Java for enhanced functionality and performance in back-end systems. Additionally, I utilize cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, as well as containerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes, to deploy applications that are both scalable and highly available. In my previous roles, I have worked within Agile environments, engaging in all stages of the software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering and design to development, testing, and deployment. I am adept at setting up CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins to automate deployment processes, and I document APIs using Swagger for maintainability and support. I am passionate about delivering high-quality software solutions and am excited to bring my skills to a dynamic and forward-thinking team.",
