        description: "Hello, my name is Swetha Paspunuri, and I am a Java Full Stack Developer with over three years of hands-on experience in developing robust and scalable web applications. I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M University-Commerce .My expertise lies in both front-end and back-end development. I am highly proficient in Java technologies, including Core Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Security, and Hibernate. I've utilized these technologies to build efficient, scalable applications, particularly in environments that require high performance and security. On the front-end, I have extensive experience working with React.js, Angular, JavaScript, and TypeScript to create intuitive, responsive user interfaces that enhance user experience. I have experience with various databases such as MYSql , mongodb, oracle. In my current role at Cardinal Health, I developed a comprehensive web-based order management system using a full stack of Spring Boot, React.js, and MySQL. I implemented RESTful APIs to enable seamless communication between the front-end and back-end, and I ensured data integrity and efficiency using Spring Data JPA. Additionally, I integrated Docker and Kubernetes to manage containerization and orchestration, ensuring our application is both scalable and highly available. My previous role at Capgemini involved adopting a microservices architecture using Spring Boot to break down monolithic applications into smaller, independent services. This allowed for greater scalability and reduced response times. I also implemented caching mechanisms with Redis, developed front-end interfaces using React.js and HTML5, and integrated CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, which significantly improved deployment efficiency. Throughout my career, I have consistently leveraged cloud technologies like AWS for deployment and scalability, and I am adept at using tools such as Git, Jenkins, and Swagger to manage version control, automate deployments, and document APIs. I am passionate about using my technical skills to solve complex problems and deliver high-quality software solutions. I am excited about the possibility of contributing my expertise to your team and continuing to grow as a developer in a dynamic and challenging environment.",
